This React single-page application (SPAs) allows users to create surveys and can send them in bulk to their recipients lists. 

Made for marketing teams and product teams, the user's survey entries persist on the server until the user navigates away from the survey area (such as to the dashboard page or logs out).

Many more usaibility features could be added, but for now this rich, lightning-fast SPA is a great start. Modeled after StephenGrider React course.
